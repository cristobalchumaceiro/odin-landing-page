# odin-landing-page

## Introduction
As part of the Foundations course on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about), I created this simple landing page for a fictional website, along with placeholders for images and some placeholder text.

## Skills
This was a slightly more involved project compared to [odin-recipes](https://github.com/cristobalchumaceiro/odin-recipes), as the layout relies completely on flexboxes, a new concept that had been introduced to me in recent lessons. The landing page uses both `row` and `column` flexboxes to organise all of its elements, along with flex properties such as `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink`, and positioning properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, `gap` and more. The examples I worked off of are provided by The Odin Project and can be found here: [Image 1 (Full Design)](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png) [Image 2 (Color and Fonts)](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/a38403e7d81cc8305af16ac48985cfbde87834d6/foundations/html_css/flexbox/project-landing-page/imgs/02.png)

## Conclusion
It was a useful learning experience, and helped cement my knowledge of flex boxes in CSS in preparation for future projects.
